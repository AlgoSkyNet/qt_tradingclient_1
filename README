This is a public base for a multithreaded Qt C++ trading application 
which uses POSIX IB TWS API forked from Ruediger Meier's repository 
[https://github.com/rudimeier/twsapi], QuantLib-1.2.1, CUDA 5.0, 
Posix threads and Qt 5.0 as gui library.
This is only public base. Individual modules, strategies,
trading algorithms, pricing snippets or Monte Carlo simulations
are not included here, they are being now developed in another,
private repository.
This trading client application is compiled 
on Ubuntu 12.10 with g++ 4.7.
